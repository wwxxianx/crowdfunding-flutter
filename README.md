- If you wish to place an order in the application, you can enroll in the [Google Pay API Test Cards Allowlist](https://groups.google.com/g/googlepay-test-mode-stub-data). This will provide you with mock card details, allowing you to safely test the order placement functionality within a controlled environment.

- For the GitHub version of Flutterzon apk provided above, please note that certain administrative features, such as the ability to delete products and offers, have been intentionally disabled to prevent unintended tampering with the actual database. The original codebase, accessible to you, includes the complete functionality, including the ability to delete products. If you wish to explore the full range of features, please refer to the original code provided.

- Please be aware that the application or APIs might experience delays in providing details, as the server is hosted on a hobby plan, If there is no activity for 15 minutes, the server may go to sleep, resulting in a delay in processing the first API request. Your patience during this process is greatly appreciated.

- If you are interested, there is another version of this project built using Provider and Flutter's `setState`. You can access it [here](https://github.com/tejasbadone/flutterzon_provider).
